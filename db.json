Must-see sights include the Anne Frank House, the Van Gogh Museum, and the world's only floating flower market. Rent a bike and join thousands of locals peddling around. Other visitors might want to linger in the local coffee shops, which is just a normal part of the city's landscape. Check out more recs below to make the most of your trip."

And don't miss Madrid's popular landmarks. A few favourites: The great bear statue in the central Puerta del Sol, the Reina Sofia and Prado museums, and Plaza Mayor.

You can’t miss the iconic 7th, where art and history meet—there’s the Eiffel Tower, sure, but the impressive Musée du quai Branly is just a short walk away. It houses an amazing collection of indigenous art. Or, hit up Montmartre (the 18th), with its boho shops and cosy brasseries. It’s a must-stop on the way up or down from Sacre Coeur. While the French practically invented fine dining, don’t skip the street food—Paris has world-class kebabs and falafel. But no matter where you are, be sure to pop into a sidewalk cafe, sip a glass of wine, and people watch—it’s the way to get a taste of true Parisian culture."

          "article": "Fiber is an essential nutrient that offers numerous health benefits. Learn about the importance of fiber in your diet and how to incorporate more fiber-rich foods:\n\n1. Supports Digestive Health: Fiber adds bulk to stool and promotes regular bowel movements, preventing constipation and promoting digestive health. It also helps prevent diverticulosis, hemorrhoids, and other digestive issues.\n\n2. Aids in Weight Management: High-fiber foods are more filling and can help control hunger and appetite, making it easier to maintain a healthy weight. Fiber slows down the digestion and absorption of carbohydrates, which helps regulate blood sugar levels and prevent overeating.\n\n3. Lowers Cholesterol Levels: Soluble fiber binds to cholesterol in the digestive tract and helps eliminate it from the body, which can lower blood cholesterol levels and reduce the risk of heart disease. Aim to include sources of soluble fiber such as oats, barley, beans, lentils, fruits, and vegetables in your diet.\n\n4. Regulates Blood Sugar Levels: Fiber slows down the absorption of sugar and helps regulate blood sugar levels, which is beneficial for individuals with diabetes or prediabetes. Choose high-fiber foods such as whole grains, legumes, fruits, and vegetables to support blood sugar control.\n\n5. Supports Gut Health: Fiber serves as fuel for beneficial bacteria in the gut, promoting a healthy balance of gut microbiota. A diverse and thriving gut microbiome is associated with better digestion, immune function, and overall health.\n\n6. Reduces the Risk of Chronic Diseases: A diet rich in fiber has been linked to a reduced risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes, and certain types of cancer. Consuming a variety of fiber-rich foods as part of a balanced diet can help support overall health and well-being.\n\nTo increase your fiber intake, focus on eating a variety of whole foods such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts, and seeds. Aim for at least 25-30 grams of fiber per day from food sources, and gradually increase your fiber intake to prevent digestive discomfort. Remember to drink plenty of water to help fiber move through your digestive system and prevent constipation.",
